        <p> <span className="bold"> Description: </span> Van Orley served as painter to the Brussels court of the Habsburg regent Margaret of Austria and also worked for her successor, Mary of Hungary. Although he may never have visited Italy, he played a crucial role in the introduction of Italian Renaissance style into the art of the Netherlands. In addition to painting altarpieces and portraits, Van Orley was a brilliant designer of tapestries and stained glass. Pentecost is one of 13 surviving cartoons (full-scale drawings) for a lost or unidentified cycle comprising at least 21 stained glass windows devoted to scenes from Christâ€™s Passion. All have a ruled vertical center line and ruled single or double horizontal lines in red chalk, which mark the positions of the metal bars that secured the glass within the window frame.</p>
